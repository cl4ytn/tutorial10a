# Experiment 2.1: Original code, and how it run
[Try to run one server, and three clients. Try to type something in each client. Capture your screen. Put it in your Readme.md. Put some explanation. How to run it, and what happens when you type some text in the clients.]

# Experiment 2.2: Modifying port
[Try to modify the port to be 8080. Test it again. Make sure it still runs properly. Remember since it is a connection, it means there are at least two sides. The server side and the client side. Find where you should modify it. Take a look at the other files that need to be modified. Is it also using the same websocket protocol? Where is it defined?
Put your explanation in the Readme.md]

# Experiment 2.3: Small changes, add IP and Port
[Make your own modification. Capture the result, put it in the Readme.md and put some explanation why you change it there]
